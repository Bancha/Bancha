Bancha - In Development
======
Ext JS and CakePHP.

What is Bancha?
---------------
First of all, it's not finished yet. Follow us on twitter @banchaproject or on our website banchaproject.org to get informed about our first release.

Bancha combines Ext JS 4 and CakePHP 2. Basically it: 

*   handles all communication between server and client
*   shares all schema and validation rules in CakePHP with ExtJs
*   enables asynchronous and batched request to the server
*   provides a Rapid Development Command Line Tool
*   is well-tested with PHPUnit, YUITest and Selenium

So with Ext JS and CakePHP in the background we aim to become the most elegant and most powerful JavaScript to PHP comunication framework.
