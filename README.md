Bancha - Combining ExtJS and CakePHP
====================================
Currently in Beta release.

What is Bancha?
---------------

Bancha combines Ext JS 4 and CakePHP 2. Basically it: 

*   handles all communication between server and client
*   shares all schema and validation rules in CakePHP with ExtJS
*   enables asynchronous and batched request to the server
*   automatically implements CRUD for all remotable models
*   is well-tested with PHPUnit and Jasmine

So with Ext JS and CakePHP in the background we aim to become the most elegant and powerful JavaScript to PHP comunication framework.
